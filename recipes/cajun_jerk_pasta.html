<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Oxtails:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Season the oxtails with salt, pepper, Cajun seasoning, and jerk seasoning.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Sear the oxtails on all sides until browned, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove and set aside.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Cook the Vegetables:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In the same pot, add the sliced onions, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, and minced garlic. Sauté until softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes.</li>    
        </ul>
    <li>Braise the Oxtails:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Return the oxtails to the pot. Add the chicken or beef broth and diced tomatoes (if using). Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 2-3 hours, or until the oxtails are tender and falling off the bone.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Cook the Pasta:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>While the oxtails are braising, cook your pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>  
        </ul>
    <li>Make the Sauce:</li>
        <ul>    
            <li>Once the oxtails are tender, remove them from the pot. Add the heavy cream, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper (if using) to the pot. Stir well and let the sauce simmer for 5-10 minutes to thicken.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Shred the Oxtails:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Carefully shred the meat from the oxtails using a fork, discarding the bones. Return the shredded meat to the sauce.</li>  
        </ul>
    <li>Combine:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Toss the cooked pasta into the pot with the sauce and braised oxtails, stirring to coat the pasta evenly with the rich, creamy mixture.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Garnish and Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese, chopped green onions, and fresh parsley. Serve hot and enjoy your Cajun Jerk Pasta with Braised Oxtails!</li>
