<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 lb large sea scallops (about 12-15)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves (or 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>Lemon wedges (for garnish)</li>
    <li>Optional sides: sautéed vegetables, risotto, or mashed potatoes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Scallops:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Pat the scallops dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Sear the Scallops:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the scallops to the pan in a single layer, making sure they do not touch each other.</li>
                <li>Sear the scallops for 2-3 minutes on each side, until they are golden brown and form a crispy crust. Remove the scallops from the skillet and set aside on a plate.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Make the Lemon Herb Butter:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium. Add the butter and minced garlic, sautéing until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Stir in the lemon juice, lemon zest, parsley, and thyme, allowing the butter sauce to simmer for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Combine and Serve:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Return the seared scallops to the skillet, spooning the lemon herb butter over them to coat evenly. Let them cook in the sauce for an additional minute to absorb the flavors.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Garnish and Serve:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the scallops from the skillet and plate them. Garnish with fresh parsley and lemon wedges. Serve with your favorite sides like sautéed vegetables, risotto, or mashed potatoes.</li>
            </ul>
